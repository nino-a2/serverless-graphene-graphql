# General info
To run and deploy this project, first go through the steps written in 'src/README.md', and then proceed to the steps written in 'iac/README.md'.

# Prequisites
- An AWS account (with provisioned permissions to create Lambda Functions, an API Gateway, and to perform IAM operations).
- Access to the AWS account via an Access Key
- The AWS CLI installed and configured for the aforementioned account
- Terraform (HashiCorp)
- Python3.9 (per default. You can use different versions, but also make sure and test that it works well with the Python code and the configuration defined in the 'iac' folder.

# Project info
The project contains a GraphQL API developed using Graphene (Python). The project can either:
- run locally, which is enabled by Flask (which can also be deployed on EC2, or containerized and executed on ECS, Fargate, EKS, or totally different cloud platforms), or
- run as a serverless AWS Lambda Function, which is exposed via API Gateway.

NOTE: In this project, API Gateway requires an API key. The API key is generated by AWS and requested through the Terraform code.
The value of the API key can (e.g) be retrieved from the API Gateway Console.
